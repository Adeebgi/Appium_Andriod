 How to find App Package and App Activity of your Android App



1. Firstly, connect your Android device or emulator to the PC/Mac and open the App whose details you want to inspect 
i.e Whatsapp.

 

2. Open a Command Prompt or Terminal window and use ‘adb devices‘ command to see the list of connected devices. 
A list of Android devices connected to the Computer is displayed along with their device IDs as shown below:
or now, we have only one device connected to this System.



3. Finally, type the below-given command to get the information about the currently open application, 
i.e in our case, WhatsApp.



For Mac/Linux:

adb shell dumpsys window | grep -E 'mCurrentFocus' 
For Windows:

adb shell dumpsys window | find "mCurrentFocus"

Here, the part before the '/' character i.e com.whatsapp is the Package name and the part after
 that i.e com.whatsapp.HomeActivity is the Activity name.
